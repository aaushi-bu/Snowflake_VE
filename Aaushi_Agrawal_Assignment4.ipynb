In\\naddition to the computational content of the course, we will encounter numerous problems that\\narise in the context of physics and engineering. A detailed course outline containing the learning\\nobjectives for this class is available at\\nhttps://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/math/1/documents/142.pdf\\nExams/Quizzes\\n•Midterm exams will be given on the following dates.\\nMT1: Friday, October 18\\nMT2: Friday, November 15\\n•The ﬁnal exam is comprehensive. We will adhere to the Cal Poly ﬁnal exam schedule.1The\\nﬁnal exam will take place on Wednesday, December 11.\\n•The midterm and ﬁnal exams are each worth 100 points. An exam score Ewill be assigned\\naccording to the formula\\nE=MT1 +MT2 +F+F−D,\\nwhere Dis the lowest of your midterm scores ( MT1 and MT2) or ﬁnal score F(i.e., the ﬁnal\\nexam score is initially counted twice and the lowest of the 3 exam scores is is dropped).\\n•Quizzes will be given regularly (see accompanying schedule); each quiz is worth 20 points.\\nYour total quiz score Qis computed as\\nQ=X−L\\n2.4\\n1This policy is not negotiable.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Synthesizing Digital Efforts/Assignment 4/syllabus_dataset/6___syllabus.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='where Xis the sum of your seven quiz scores and Lis the lowest of your quiz scores (i.e., the\\nlowest quiz score is dropped).\\n•No make-up exams or quizzes will be given . If you miss a midterm exam or quiz for\\nany reason, it will automatically become the “dropped” score.\\nHomework\\nHomework will be assigned at the beginning of each class period (excluding quiz, review and exam\\ndays) and is due the following class meeting.

Homework sets will be assigned at regular\\nintervals throughout the quarter (roughly once a week). Each assignment will be worth 20 points.\\nThe points will be allocated as follows:\\n•(15 points) I will choose a subset of the problems. These exercises will be graded carefully,\\nwith an emphasis on the format and logical ﬂow of your proofs. Since I will not announce\\nmy selections until after the assignments are turned in, students should treat each problem\\nas though it will be graded.\\n•(5 points) The remaining 5 points will be based on the level of completion and overall ap-\\npearance of your write-ups.\\nI will announce the assignments (and due dates) in class. I will also post this information on the\\nweb. Once everyone has turned in their homework I will post solutions on the course web site. Late\\nhomework will be accepted but penalized at a rate of 5 points per day .\\nExams\\nAn in-class midterm exam will be given on Friday, May 3, and contributes 25% to your course\\ngrade.

Basic computer literacy   Course Objectives   Learn the basic principles of algorithmic problem solving and procedural abstraction. Exposure to the software development process: top-down design, incremental development, testing, and documentation. Learn the syntax and semantics of a modern programming language (C). To be successfully prepared for CPE/CSC 102. Enjoy solving puzzles = enjoy computer science.   Required Text(s)   Problem Solving and Program Design in C by J. Hanly and E. Koffman (5th Edition)   Recommended Text(s)   The C Programming Language, Second Edition by Kernighan and Ritchie, Prentice Hall, Inc.,   Policies and Advisories   1)      This course will have a common final scheduled for either Tuesday or Wednesday from 7-10:00pm of finals week – no other finals will be given! 2)      The College of Engineering requires proof of unusual circumstances to withdraw from a course after the eighth day of the quarter. 3)      Projects must be submitted on or before the date and time specified in the assignment to receive credit.  Late projects will not be accepted.  However, students each have two free days, which may be used during the quarter for any of the programming assignments. 4)      There are no makeup exams or quizzes except in documented and extreme emergencies. 5)      A course grade of incomplete is given only for reasons acceptable to the university. ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Synthesizing Digital Efforts/Assignment 4/syllabus_dataset/20___syllabus09.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='6)      Plagiarism on projects will result in all involved students (student(s) who copied and student(s) who were copied from) being failed from the course.  In addition, a report of the incident will be reported to the university’s Judicial Affairs department, which may result in being dismissed from the university.  Please note that all programs will be checked automatically for plagiarism.   Lecture and Lab Attendance   Attendance and participation in the course is mandatory.  Participation includes responding to questions in class, lab or office hours and making observations or discussing course material in class, lab or office hours.    Reading and Homework   You are expected to read the assigned chapters prior to class.  Not all material in the reading will be covered in lecture or lab but you are still responsible for knowing it for quizzes and exams.  Come to class prepared with any questions from the reading that you would like addressed.   There is no graded homework.  However, make sure you are familiar with the concepts in the chapter summaries and comfortable with the questions and exercises at the end of each assigned chapter.  Don’t be surprised if you see material like this on your quizzes and exams.   Lab and Lab Exercises    Regular and frequent labs will be assigned and collected each week and, together, will comprise 15% of your course grade.  The three hours of scheduled lab time each week is the primary time your instructor will be available for questions and assistance – make wise use of this resource!  You are expected to work on the lab exercises during your scheduled lab time plus as much additional time as necessary to complete them.  The lab exercises are designed to familiarize you with some of the concepts necessary to complete your projects and to help you do well on quizzes and exams.  You may work on your projects in lab after completing all currently assigned labs.   IMPORTANT: No late labs will be accepted.   NOTE: You may collaborate on lab certain exercises (as specified).   Projects   There will be five projects over the quarter that, together, comprise 29% of your course grade.  Projects will consist of analysis, design, documentation, and program development and will be graded based on their functionality as well as the quality of the implementation – including coding style, efficiency, and documentation.    IMPORTANT: No late projects will be accepted.   ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Synthesizing Digital Efforts/Assignment 4/syllabus_dataset/20___syllabus09.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='CAUTION: You are required to complete your projects individually (unless clearly specified in the assignment!).  You may discuss general concepts with others inside and outside of class, including tutors, but you must do the specific work on the projects on your own.  Do not even look at another student’s project code or allow another student to see yours.  Any project, in whole or part, which is suspected of being the work of more than one student, will be considered plagiarism. Projects will be compared using software that can reliably detect similarities among programs.  See the Policies and Advisories section above regarding the penalties for plagiarism.   Quizzes and Exams   There will be several separate lecture and lab quizzes, and one common lecture final.  The final exam will be cumulative and comprehensive and will cover material covered in lecture, your text, as well as programming skills of analysis, design, and implementation used in your labs and projects.  Lab quizzes will focus on programming skills and knowledge acquired primarily, though not exclusively, from labs and projects.    The lecture quizzes are intended to measure your understanding of the course material. If you score below 75% on the first lecture quiz, then you will be required to attend 105 meetings or tutoring sessions to prepare for a makeup quiz. Scoring higher on the makeup quiz than on the original quiz will improve your recorded quiz score (to a maximum of 75%).  The programming quizzes are used to check minimum programming proficiency. Each quiz must be an individual effort without input from your classmates or any other external sources. These will be administered in lab, but you will be able to practice prior to the quiz date. You must demonstrate minimal proficiency on these programming quizzes in order to earn a course grade better than a D+.    NOTE (Unless otherwise specified):   The lecture quizzes, midterm, and final are closed-note and closed-book.  Lab quizzes are closed-note, closed-source, closed-web, and closed-book (unless otherwise noted).

Overall certification includes: • IT303 Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Course (taken separately) ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Synthesizing Digital Efforts/Assignment 4/syllabus_dataset/3___Syllabus-Lean-Sigma-Green-Belt-Cert12.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='Eric Olsen  Cal Poly – Orfalea College of Business – Central Coast Lean  \\nSyllabus\\t-\\tLean\\tSigma\\tGreen\\tBelt\\tCert12.docx\\tPage\\t2\\t o 80 hours of online training o Completion of a Mini-Project o Successful completion of a 3 hour online exam • 120 hours of lean six sigma related work experience (completed separately prior to or concurrent with this course) • A mentored Green Belt level project (this course) This course may be completed entirely online, although occasional physical meetings with the course instructor are encouraged. Prerequisites  The following prerequisites are minimum requirements for acceptance in this course.  It is recommended that potential candidates contact the instructor (eolsen@calpoly.edu) prior to enrolling in the course to make sure all prerequisites are in order. Green Belt projects typically take 3-9 months to complete. Project completion feasibility should be considered prior to enrollment. 1. Successful completion of the Cal Poly Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Course with the following minimum grades: • Online Quizzes:  80% weighted average  • Mini-Project:  80%  • Online Final Exam:  80% • Course grade overall:  B- 2. Draft Project Charter for the required Green Belt Project.  A Project Charter form is included as Appendix C.  This should be reviewed with the Instructor (eolsen@calpoly.edu) prior to registering for this course.  It is the candidate’s responsibility to find an acceptable project for this course. 3. Read the Singo Model Handbook. The student may submit a formal appeal to waive select perquisites with the approval of the instructor and demonstration that deficiencies are adequately addressed. Mentored Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Project  For certification, each candidate must complete a significant Green Belt level project.  The project is “mentored” and must be completed under guidance of the course instructor.  The minimum required elements of the project are listed under “Green Belt Requirements Project 1” in Appendix A.  Note that theses are the minimum requirements and that additional tools and analyses may need to be applied to properly address the Project Charter.   Project tracking software from MoreSteam (https://www.moresteam.com/traction/index.cfm ) is provided to the candidate as part of the certification process.    COURSE MATERIALS A.

C. Student candidates can also download a free copy of Minitab (optional) from the Cal Poly Website. D. Shingo Model Handbook provided by instructor.  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION Evaluation based on the candidate’s meeting the minimum acceptable performance criteria for the certification elements covered in this course: 1. Completion of stage gate review for each stage of the DMAIC process (i.e. Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control). 2. Demonstrated competency in all the tools indicated in Appendix A. 3. Project Results Report.  See Appendix D for requirements.  POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Time Expectation  This is an independent, fixed start course selected by the candidate based on a reasonable expectation that the project can be completed in a specified period of time.  Having previously taken the IT303 Lean Six Sigma Green Belt course, the student would have a relatively clear view of expectations.  They would also do some pre-work and speak to the instructor (mentor) about the feasibility of completing the projects on time.  Completing a draft project charter (see Appendix C) is a prerequisite and part of the course admission process.  The course duration is set at 1 quarter.  However, typical Green Belt project run 3-9 months in duration.  At the end of each quarter the student will either complete the course or receive a “RP” for a grade is reasonable progress is being made. In a case where the project is not completed prior to graduation, a grade will be assigned based on percent completion and the quality of work to that point. Certification can be completed while enrolled at Cal Poly or within 5 years of completing the online training course (IT303) if no longer enrolled.  Personal Integrity Policy  The penalty for cheating is expulsion from the course.  Cheating occurs when your take credit for work that you did not do.  Plagiarism occurs when students copy sections of another author’s material without referencing it.  I am a strong believer in accessing resources and discussing problems outside the course, but be sure to give credit where credit is due.

Schedule:  Depends on class.  \\nTextbook:  R. Knight, Physics for Scientists and Engineers\\n , 3rd Edition (or 2nd or 1st) \\n Exams: We will have three exams throughout the quart er. Exam dates will be announced in class.  \\n \\nHomework: \\nThe homework is a critical part of understanding the material covered in this  course.  Physics can \\nonly be learned by working many different types of problems.  If you can't solve a problem the first time, have somebody show you how.  At a la ter time, try working the problem again without \\nlooking at the solution.  The exam questions  will be similar to the homework problems; \\nconsequently it will be essential to understand\\n the homework.  Homework is due as announced in \\nclass and will not be accepted after this date.  In  addition to the help I can provide during my \\noffice hours, the learning center in 180-368 will be staffed with a physics faculty or tutor who can help you with the homework during the hours pos ted outside the door. Individual tutors are \\navailable at a price by inquiring with the physics department office for a list. You can also sign up \\nfor a study session at the Cal Poly portal. \\n \\nOn-Line Homework: The on-line homework system, “mastering physics”,  will be used during the quarter. To learn \\nmore about creating an account and using this  homework system look at the handout, using \\n“mastering physics” available in class today and fro m my web page. To log on the first time you \\nwill need our course ID number which I will e-mail to you soon. \\n Workbook: The workbook will not be collected and graded. However, the workbook will help tremendously \\ntowards focusing your reading and preparing you for the homework problems. I would recommend working the corresponding workbook section after reading each section in the \\ntextbook.  \\n Activities: Throughout the quarter we will be conducting experiments that are introduced in class and \\nfinished outside of class. Since physics is an experimental science, my hope is these experiments \\nwill increase your understanding of the material c overed in lecture in the absence of a formal \\nlaboratory experiment.  Grading: Your final grade will be based on your over all performance in the class with the following \\napproximate percentages:  three exams (55/50%),  homework and activities (15%), and final exam \\n(30/35%). \", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Synthesizing Digital Efforts/Assignment 4/syllabus_dataset/12___WebPageSly.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='Math 440/540 – Topology I\\nWinter 2015\\nCourse Syllabus\\nInstructor: Anton Kaul\\nOﬃce: 25-312 (Faculty Oﬃces East)\\nPhone: 6-1678\\nemail: akaul@calpoly.edu\\nOﬃce Hours: Monday 2-3, Tuesday 12-1, Thursday 12-1, Friday 2-3\\nCourse Web Page: www.calpoly.edu/ ∼akaul/teaching/Math440\\nTextbook\\nThe text for the course is Gamelin and Green, Introduction to Topology , 2nd ed.\\nCourse Description\\nThe ﬁrst part of this quarter will be spent covering the standard topics of point-set topology, in-\\ncluding metric spaces, topological spaces, compactness, completeness, connectivity, product spaces\\nand quotient spaces.

Math is not a spectator sport;\\nyou have to explore and practice the material on your own. Actively participate in class by\\nasking questions and seek help early if you are having trouble with the homework: from other\\nstudents, or from me in oﬃce hours or class. The assigned homework should be considered as\\na minimum number of problems to be worked; the problems are chosen to provide a reasonable\\nsampling of the material. You are encouraged to work with other students while doing your\\nhomework in order to foster a better understanding of the material. You should expect to\\nspend an average of 2-3 hours studying for each lecture hour of class; hence the 25-35 hours\\nper week program of the College of Science and Mathematics.\\nReading Questions (10%): A short list of questions for each section of the text which will be\\ndue at the beginning of the discussion of that section. The lowest two scores will be dropped.\\nHomework and Quizzes (13%): Homework will not be collected; instead, a short (1-2\\nquestion) quiz or in-class worksheet will be given most weeks (except for weeks with an exam).\\nThe lowest quiz score will be dropped. Make-up quizzes will not be given; exceptions to this\\ncan be made if arrangements are made prior to the beginning of lecture .\\nMidterms (44% pts): There will be two in-class exams (22% each). Makeup exams will not\\nbe given. Your lowest midterm score will be replaced by your ﬁnal score (as a percentage) if the\\nﬁnal score is higher. The midterms are tentatively scheduled for the following days (subject to\\nchange with prior notice): Thursday, April 19th; Tuesday May 15th.\\nFinal Exam (33%): Friday, June 8th, 1:10pm-4:00pm , same room as the lectures. The ﬁnal\\nexam is comprehensive. You must take the Final Exam at the scheduled time.\\nEvaluation: Scoring above 90% / 80% / 70% / 60% is guarenteed to earn an A / B / C / D\\ngrade, respectively. These percentage thresolds may be lowered slightly, but will not be raised.\\nAcademic Honesty: The Cal Poly catalog summarizes the University’s policy regarding\\ncheating and plagiarism: “As a student, you are responsible for your own work and you are\\nresponsible for your actions.” Students who violate academic integrity will meet the stiﬀest\\npossible penalties.

Much of the fall quar-\\nter will be devoted to group theory, including subgroups, quotient groups, permutation groups,\\nhomomorphisms, the ﬁrst isomorphism theorem and its consequences, and the fundamental the-\\norem of ﬁnite abelian groups. Rings and ﬁelds may be introduced in the latter part of the\\nquarter. A detailed course outline containing the learning objectives for this class is available\\nathttp://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/math/1/documents/481.pdf\\nHomework\\nHomework contributes 40% to your ﬁnal course grade. Homework sets will be assigned at regular\\nintervals throughout the quarter. Each assignment will be worth 20 points. The points will be\\nallocated as follows:\\n•(15 points) I will choose a subset of the problems. These exercises will be graded carefully,\\nwith an emphasis on the format and logical ﬂow of your proofs. Since I will not announce\\nmy selections until after the assignments are turned in, students should treat each problem\\nas though it will be graded.\\n•(5 points) The remaining 5 points will be based on the level of completion and overall ap-\\npearance of your write-ups.\\nI will announce the assignments and and due dates in class. I will also post this information on the\\ncourse website. Once everyone has turned in their homework I will post solutions. Late homework\\nwill be accepted but penalized at a rate of 5 points per day .\\nExams\\nAn in-class midterm examination will be held on Friday, October 26.

It’s goal is to present certainenvironmental material, their interrelationships, and human interactions with thatenvironment.  The course will review certain biophysical components (e.g., soils,vegetation) that give a site its identity.  We will also review built elements (e.g.,roads, buildings) that should be considered when conducting a site analysis.  Thelocation of those elements and their relationship to each other create patterns inthe landscape that provide clues about a place\\'s complexity, fragility and potential.Natural and introduced elements typically come together at sites to create complexsystems.  These systems tell us stories about the ways that humans mightinteract there.  Questions about a site can be answered only if we take the time tounderstand the land\\'s complexities.  Typical questions are:•What is the \"value\" or \"worth\" of a site?  To whom?  Why?•Is a landscape suitable for development? Is it not?•Is it a sensitive place worth preserving?•Are there opportunities and/or limitations that might restrict some activities?Growth and Development creates varying degrees of environmental impacts thatultimately can cause environments to change.
